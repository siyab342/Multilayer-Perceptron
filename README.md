# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Tutorial

## Overview
This project explores the impact of depth (hidden layers) and width (neurons per layer) on **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) performance** using the **MNIST dataset**. It includes model training, evaluation, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

## Dataset
- **Dataset**: MNIST Handwritten Digits (0-9)
- **Training Data**: 60,000 images
- **Test Data**: 10,000 images
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels
- **Source**: [MNIST Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook MLP_Implementation.ipynb
```
### Option 2: Python Script
```sh
python mlp_train.py
```

## Results
- **Accuracy**: The 4-layer MLP performed better but required more training time.
- **Loss**: The deeper network had higher initial loss but converged better.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows fewer misclassifications in the 4-layer model.

## Regularization & Optimization
- **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons.
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes learning and accelerates convergence.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Adjusts learning rates dynamically.

## Applications of MLPs
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, stock market predictions.
- **Healthcare**: Disease classification from medical reports.
- **NLP**: Sentiment analysis, text classification.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Robotics, sensor data processing.
